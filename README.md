# DayScheduler

## Description

This project was wonderful learning experience in Jquery. I wanted to create a planner that I could personally use daily so that I could remember all the things that I needed to do that day. The design is simple and clean, yet effective.
I wanted this planner to be minimal in design and simply do its job. 
I wanted to practice writing javascript and jquery in order to develop my own skills as a coder. 

## Installation

To install this application, simply copy the code from my repo and clone it in your terminal.

## Usage

To use this daily planner, simply click on the timeslot that you would like to enter text into (ex: 10 am), write the things that you need to do during that hour (ex: catch up on homework, make breakfast, do laundry, etc.), and click the save button that is on the end of each individual time slot.
